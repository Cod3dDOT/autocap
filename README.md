# autocap

Small tool to simplify packet capture and client deauth using [aircrack-ng](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/) on a target client, on a target network.

This project was initially created for Raspberry Pi with an external wifi adapter.
Written in Python3.

Fun fact: this project exists only because I haven't read the readme for wifite2, and thought it did not have only handshake mode. Moral of the story: always read the readme! On a serious note, check out [wifite2](https://github.com/derv82/wifite2), it's a far better tool.

## IMPORTANT

You must use autocap only on networks you have permission to.

## Installation

Install:
```
git clone https://github.com/Cod3dDOT/autocap
cd autocap
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Default:
```
python3 autocap.py -i wlan0 NETWORK
```
To retain internet connection:
```
python3 autocap.py -i interface NETWORK --nokill
```
This will not kill NetworkManager, allowing you to retain internet connection on other interfaces. <b>May not work depending upon your software/firmware.</b>

All options ```python3 autocap.py -h```:
```

Automatically capture handshake

positional arguments:
  NETWORK        Network name.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -i INTERFACE   Interface.
  -c CONFIDENCE  Confidence in guessing network name from 0 to 1 (default = 0.6).
  -p PACKETS     Amount of packets to send (default = 10)
  -d DIRECTORY   Directory, in which .cap file is stored (default = mydirectory/wifis/NETWORK/)
  --nokill       Won't kill NetworkManager. May not work depending upon your software/firmware.
  --nolog        Won't print anything to console. (Why?)
  --noclear      Won't clear files generated by airmong-ng.
